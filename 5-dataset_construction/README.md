# Dataset Construction
We construct the datasets for our system using templates specifically designed for (1) injecting both event and entity type knowledge (evt+ent), (2) injecting only event type knowledge (evt), and (3) injecting only entity types knowledge (ent), respectively.

- For (1), please run the code in `./create_dataset_1.ipynb`
- For (2), please run the code in `./create_dataset_3.ipynb`
- For (3), please run the code in `./create_dataset_4.ipynb`
